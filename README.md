# Bipolar Disorder and Reward Sensitivity: A Spectrum Analysis

## Abstract
The field of psychology has traditionally categorized individuals under specific disorders, resulting in a lack of recognition for comorbidities and hard boundaries for diagnosis. This report focuses on individuals with bipolar disorder and their higher reward sensitivity. The report discusses the shift towards a spectrum system that allows for comorbidities and focuses on a certain set of disorders instead of drilling down on one. The dataset used in the [original paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702617718181) we will be analyzing has data on comorbidities, but the paper concentrates only on Bipolar I. Results show that individuals with bipolar disorder have a higher inclination towards financial rewards rather than fame-related rewards. In this report we will discuss and analyze if internalizing disorders show more avoidance to risky situations for reward, while externalizing disorders approach riskier situations for reward.

## Hypotheses
During the course of this project, we have formulated three hypotheses that we intend to prove/disprove through statistical analysis of the provided data:

1. Individuals with comorbid anxiety disorder will show a lower proportion of hard tasks selected on the EEfRt compared to baseline and score lower on WASSUP Popular Fame and Financial success scales.
2. Individuals with a history of comorbid substance use disorder will show a higher proportion of hard tasks selected on the EEfRt compared to baseline and score higher on WASSUP Popular Fame and Financial success scales.
3. Individuals with both comorbidities will show the highest proportion of hard tasks selected on the EEfRT and WASSUP Popular Fame and Financial success scales.

These hypotheses are based on our assumptions that internalizing comorbidities, such as anxiety, would negatively impact an individual and decrease their risk-taking behavior, while externalizing comorbidities, such as substance abuse, would have the opposite effect, potentially even overriding any internalizing comorbidities.
